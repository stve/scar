Soundcloud artwork downloader

## Usage

Pass the URL of the track you'd like to download the artwork for. Files will be downloaded to `~/Downloads` and will be stored in the form `{track name}.jpg`.

```
scar https://soundcloud.com/artist/track
```

## Note

It's possible this violates Soundcloud's terms of service. I have read through the TOS and while they have restrictions on downloading streams, there is no obvious provision in place for artwork.
