# scar

Soundcloud artwork downloader

## Usage

Pass the URL of the track you'd like to download the artwork for. Files will be downloaded to `~/Downloads` and will be stored in the form `{track name}.jpg`.

```
scar https://soundcloud.com/artist/track
```

### Saving to a specific directory

```
scar --directory ~/Desktop https://soundcloud.com/artist/track
```

### Saving with a specific filename

```
scar --filename cover.jpg https://soundcloud.com/artist/track
```

## Note

It's possible this violates Soundcloud's terms of service. I have read through the TOS and while they have restrictions on downloading streams, there is no obvious provision in place for artwork.
